# Liam Robinson Hounsell

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Liam, a passionate and driven Software Engineering student from Melbourne, Australia. I thrive on learning new technologies, tackling complex challenges, and creating impactful projects.

## About Me

I'm currently pursuing a Bachelor of Software Engineering at [Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT)](https://www.rmit.edu.au), expected to graduate in July 2027.

I also founded and currently run the RMIT Sailing Club, blending my love for sailing with leadership and community building.  
**Note:** The majority of my projects on GitHub are private due to organization policies or personal content (e.g., Vangbot includes sensitive real-world references, and school projects are automatically private).
